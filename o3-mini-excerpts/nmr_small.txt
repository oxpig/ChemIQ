Prompt:
Write the SMILES string of the molecule consistent with this data:

Formula: C6H14N2O

1H NMR: δ 1.40-1.64 (4H, 1.47 (tt, J = 7.4, 7.3 Hz), 1.58 (quint, J = 7.4 Hz)), 1.86 (3H, s), 2.63 (2H, t, J = 7.3 Hz), 3.17 (2H, t, J = 7.4 Hz).

13C NMR: δ 23.1 (1C, s), 26.9 (1C, s), 27.9 (1C, s), 40.0 (1C, s), 41.0 (1C, s), 179.7 (1C, s).

Only write the SMILES string. Do not write stereochemistry. Do not write any comments.

Reasoning:
The user wants the SMILES string for a molecule with the formula C6H14N2O based on NMR data. The presence of a carbonyl group at 179.7 ppm suggests it's likely an acid. The molecule has two nitrogen atoms and one oxygen — which directs me toward options like a carboxylic acid or amide. However, guanidine doesn’t fit the formula, so I’ll need to think about other possibilities that meet this structure. Let's narrow this down further!

Looking at the 1H NMR data, the signals suggest two different CH2 groups (1.40-1.64), a methyl singlet (1.86), and two CH2 groups next to a carbonyl or nitrogen (2.63 and 3.17). The carbonyl from a potential acetamide shows at 179.7 ppm.

The hydrogen count is odd, though. The integration adds up to 11 hydrogens, but the formula requires 14. I’m wondering if there are exchangeable NH protons that weren't observed in the NMR — that's probably where the extra hydrogens are.

After reconsidering the molecule's structure and the NMR data, the formula C6H14N2O fits with N-acetyl-1,4-diaminobutane. This structure has 6 carbon atoms, 14 hydrogen atoms, 2 nitrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom, matching the formula exactly.

For the NMR signals: the singlet at 1.86 ppm corresponds to the acetyl group, while the two triplets from 2.63 and 3.17 ppm match CH2 groups adjacent to nitrogen and a carbonyl. This molecule seems to fit well!
