Prompt:
Determine the score of the unknown molecule.

Index SMILES Score
0 c12c(Br)ccc(Br)c1c(F)co2 478
1 c12c(Br)ccc(F)c1c(Cl)co2 279
2 c12c(Cl)ccc(Br)c1c(Cl)co2 505
3 c12c(F)ccc(Br)c1c(Cl)co2 634
4 c12c(Br)ccc(Br)c1c(Br)co2 522
5 c12c(F)ccc(F)c1c(Br)co2 539
6 c12c(Br)ccc(Cl)c1c(F)co2 346

Unknown molecule: c12c(F)ccc(Cl)c1c(Br)co2

Write your answer as an integer only. Do not write any comments.

Reasoning:
I’m given an unknown molecule with the SMILES string "c12c(F)ccc(Cl)c1c(Br)co2" and its possible score. The known molecules share similar structures with different substituent positions.

It seems like the scoring could involve comparing the positions of X, Y, Z — the halogen substituents (F, Cl, Br) — and finding patterns or interpolation between them. I'll consider the substitutions and try to match or approximate the score based on these patterns. Let's break down the possible patterns in the table.

Okay, based on the provided molecules, I can use the SMILES string pattern "c12c(X)ccc(Y)c1c(Z)co2" and assign positions as A, B, and C. For each index in the table, A, B, C correspond to various halogen substitutions at specific positions. The unknown molecule has X = F, Y = Cl, Z = Br. I’m thinking that maybe the score results from some combination of these values, potentially in a linear model summing contributions from those substituents. Let me set up some equations to explore the relationships further.

I'm working through a system where the score depends on the effects of various substitutions at positions A, B, and C. Based on 7 known examples, I wrote equations for each molecule. Now, I want to determine the unknown score by considering the differences between equations that only differ in one substituent. By subtracting these equations, I get relationships like (b_Br - b_F) = 199, and (c_Br - c_F) = 44. Now I need to use these relationships to estimate the unknown score for the molecule with A=F, B=Cl, and C=Br.
